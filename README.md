# Description
Data Streamer Connect is an Open Source Project and Sample that demonstrates the following:

1. Wrapping [Microsoft MakeCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt) in a Windows UWP application
2. Adding Blocks and JavaScript for the Arudino UNO using the [Windows Provider Model](https://github.com/ms-iot/BusProviders/tree/develop/Arduino) and [RemoteArduino](https://github.com/ms-iot/remote-wiring/blob/develop/README.md) built on the [Firmata Protocol](http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page)
3. Adding a [Windows AppService](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/how-to-create-and-consume-an-app-service) to a MakeCode UWP App to communicate with the [Microsoft Hacking STEM Data Streamer Excel Plugin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56976)
4. Adding example Blocks and JavaScript to communicate with Windows 10 platform API
5. Upgrade Arudino Uno firmware programmatically with a pre-defined hex program

# Setting up the development environment

To setup your development machine you will need to install:

1. Visual Studio Community 2017 or better
    * Install the Universal Windows Platform development workload
    * Ensure that the following optional components are selected
        * C++ Universal Windows Platform tools
        * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.15063.0)

# Updating the embedded Microsoft MakeCode instance
Data Streamer Connect is built using Microsoft MakeCode. To update the instance you will need to:

1. Clone this repository
    * You should create your own branch to contain any changes
2. Open DataStreamerConnect.sln and build the project (either x86 or x64)
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.12.0/node-v8.12.0-x64.msi)
    * Ensure that Node.js is added to the path
4. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
5. Download the [Sample PXT target](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-sample)
    * Data Streamer Connect uses the sample PXT implementation as the base for its instance
6. Open the ZIP file and copy the files from the pxt-sample-master folder to the PXT folder in the Data Streamer Connect repository
    * **NOTE:** There are existing files in this folder that should not be overwritten:
        * package.json
        * pxtarget.json
        * targetconfig.json
        * docs/static/hero.png
        * libs/core/ns.ts
        * sim/api.ts
        * sim/apiwinrt.ts
        * sim/simulator.ts
7. Open the PXT folder in Visual Studio Code and then open a CMD Terminal for that folder location
8. In the terminal window run the following commands:
    * npm install -g pxt
    * npm install
9. Build the static package that Data Streamer Connect uses by running "pxt staticpkg" in the terminal window
    * The first pass will generate a number of "Skipped data-uri" warning. These can be ignored
10. Copy the files from PXT\built\packaged **except** for index.html into the DataStreamerConnect\DataStreamerConnect (this is the root folder of the UWP JavaScript application)
11. Build the DataStreamerConnect solution or create a Microsoft Store package
    * Only x86 and x64 packages are supported
    * To install the created packages run "Add-AppDevPackage.ps1" with PowerShell and follow the prompts
